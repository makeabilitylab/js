## Canvas Size in HTML/JS

I'm making interactive artwork with html5 and raw Javascript (using 2d rendering context on the canvas).

I'm curious about the difference between the div size of the canvas and what we set the width/height to in .js. They seem different. For example:

### The HTML

```HTML
<body>
  <div class="container">
    <canvas id="myCanvas"></canvas>
  </div>
  <script type="module" src="sketch.js"></script>
</body>
```

### The Body

```CSS
body {
  margin: 0px;
  padding: 0px;
}

canvas {
  display: block;
  margin: 0px;
  width: 400px;
  height: 400px;
}
```

And then in .js :

```JavaScript
const canvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas');
canvas.width = 1000;
canvas.height = 1000;
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

console.log(canvas.width, canvas.height);
```

### Gemini's response

I'd be glad to explain the differences between the div size of the canvas and the width/height set in JavaScript:

**Div Size:**

- Determined by CSS properties like `width` and `height` applied to the `<div>` element.
- Represents the overall size of the container that holds the canvas element.
- Can be adjusted independently of the canvas's internal dimensions.

**JavaScript Width/Height:**

- Set using the `canvas.width` and `canvas.height` properties in JavaScript.
- Directly control the internal resolution and drawing surface of the canvas element.
- Affect the scale and precision of graphics drawn on the canvas.

**Key Differences:**

- **Purpose:** Div size sets the container's dimensions, while JavaScript width/height defines the canvas's internal drawing area.
- **Impact:** Changes to div size don't directly affect the canvas's drawing resolution, but JavaScript width/height modifications do.
- **Relationship:** The canvas element's size is typically constrained by the div's dimensions, but it can be larger or smaller if explicitly set in JavaScript.

**In Your Example:**

- The CSS sets the div's width and height to 400px.
- The JavaScript sets the canvas's width and height to 1000px.
- This creates a mismatch between the container's size and the canvas's internal dimensions.
- The canvas content will be scaled to fit within the div, potentially resulting in distortion or pixelation.

**To Achieve Desired Results:**

- **Match div and canvas sizes:** Set both the div's and canvas's width/height to the same values in CSS and JavaScript.
- **Adjust div size:** If you want the canvas to scale to fit within the div, set the canvas's width/height to 100% in CSS and adjust the div's size as needed.
- **Use CSS units:** Consider using relative units like `vw` or `vh` for the div's size to make it responsive to different screen sizes.

By understanding these differences and following these guidelines, you can effectively control the size and behavior of your canvas elements in HTML and JavaScript.
